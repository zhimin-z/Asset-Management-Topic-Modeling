# Machine Learning Asset Management Empirical Study Repository

This repository contains the code and data used for the empirical study on challenges in machine learning (ML) asset management, as detailed in the paper "An Empirical Study of Challenges in Machine Learning Asset Management" by Zhimin Zhao et al.

## Overview
The study leverages general discussion forums (e.g. Stack Overflow), repository-specific discussion forums (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket), and tool-specific discussion forums to collect data for insights into the challenges and solutions related to ML asset management.

## Contents
1. **Code**: Contains the code used for data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
2. **Data**: Includes the datasets collected from various forums, the filtered and preprocessed data, and the final dataset used for analysis.
