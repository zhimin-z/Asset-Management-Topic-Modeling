This repository hosts the code and data for the research conducted in [An Empirical Study of Challenges in Machine Learning Asset Management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-024-10474-4) by Zhimin Zhao et al. The study explores the multifaceted challenges encountered in managing ML assets, drawing data from diverse online discussion forums.

## Overview
Our study systematically gathers and analyzes data from general discussion forums (e.g., [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)), repository-specific forums (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)), and tool-specific forums (e.g., [DVC](https://discuss.dvc.org)). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the prevalent challenges and emerging solutions in ML asset management.

## Contents
1. **Code**: The repository includes scripts for data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, primarily developed for topic modeling. Notably, the data mining scripts from repository-specific forums can be accessed at [MSR Asset Management](https://github.com/zhimin-z/MSR-Asset-Management), and the general and tool-specific forum counterparts at [QA Asset Management](https://github.com/zhimin-z/QA-Asset-Management).
2. **Data**: This section hosts the raw dataset sourced from various forums, alongside the curated and preprocessed data sets.
