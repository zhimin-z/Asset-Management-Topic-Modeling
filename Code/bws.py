def bws_test(x, y, numsamples=10000):
    r'''Perform the Baumgartner Weiss Schindler test on two independent samples.

    The Baumgartner Weiss Schindler test is a nonparametric test of 
    the null hypothesis that the distribution underlying sample `x` 
    is the same as the distribution underlying sample `y`. Unlike 
    the Kolmogorv-Smirnov, Wilcoxon, and Cramer-Von Mises tests, 
    the Baumgartner Weiss Schindler test weights the integral by 
    the variance of the difference in CDFs, emphasizing the tails of 
    the distributions, which increases the power of the test for 
    a lot of applications.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        N-d arrays of samples. The arrays must be broadcastable except along
        the dimension given by `axis`.
    numsamples : int, optional
        The number of samples to use in the test. Default is 10000.
    '''
    # ranks are 0-based, but we want 1-based
    rs = np.argsort(np.argsort(np.concatenate([x, y]), kind='stable')) + 1

    return bws_test_sampled_from_ranks(rs, len(x), len(y), numsamples)
